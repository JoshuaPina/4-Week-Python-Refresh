What is Pandas?

Pandas is Python’s powerhouse library for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning.
Think of it as Excel for coders, but way more powerful.

You use pandas when you want to:
	•	Read and analyze CSVs or Excel files
	•	Clean and organize messy data
	•	Group, filter, and summarize stats
	•	Prepare data for visualizations or machine learning

Core Building Block: The DataFrame
	•	A DataFrame is basically a table of data — like an Excel sheet.
	•	A Series is one column of that table.

import pandas as pd

Read a CSV file into a DataFrame: 
    df = pd.read_csv("mock_statement.csv")

Show first 5 rows: 
    print(df.head())
