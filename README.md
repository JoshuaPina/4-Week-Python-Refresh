# 4-Week Python Refresher

# Day 1 will be Monday, May 26. I am working on refreshing some of my skills, as my Fall 2024 semester was Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, DIP, and Web Dev...I did not utilize Python as much as I may have liked. 

# Day 2 involved improving the budget tracker, I also implemented some f-strings to create a rudimentary chart to organize the data. 

# Day 3 is going to involve some pandas usage.
